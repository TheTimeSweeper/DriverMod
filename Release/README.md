## Future Plans
- Many more weapons (dual uzis, railgun, minigun, etc.)
- Other things 100% decided on pure whimsy
- Proper skill icons? (unlikely given just how many weapons there are.)
- Unique monster-themed weapon drops (templar minigun, scav cannon, etc.)
- More mod crosscompat
- Unique secondary skills for each weapon; these are difficult to come up with, so feel free to hit me with any ideas!

## Known Issues
- Some weapons are missing icons or descriptions for their abilities
- Goat Hoof display is backwards
- Incompatibility with MirroredStages
